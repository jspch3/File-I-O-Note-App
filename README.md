# File-I-O-Note-App
☕ Java File I/O Demo
A simple console-based Java application demonstrating how to write to and read from a text file using FileWriter and BufferedReader.

✨ Features
Write to File: Uses FileWriter to create a file named my_notes.txt and write several lines of text to it.

Read from File: Uses BufferedReader wrapped around a FileReader for efficient line-by-line reading of the file's content.

Resource Management: Implements the try-with-resources statement to ensure file streams are automatically and safely closed.
